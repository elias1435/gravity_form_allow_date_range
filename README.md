Adding the necessary scripts via CDNs, identify the name of the text field on the Gravity Form for which you want to enable a date range picker.
Add this script below the above scripts inside the footer.
After adding the script, update your text field name where the input[name=” “] exists. You can use the Chrome Inspector tool to find the name of your field.
Now, your Gravity Forms date range picker is displayed on the form field, and you can select a date range from this field.
